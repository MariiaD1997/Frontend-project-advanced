# Front-end Project Advanced

You can look at my site here at [vercel](https://shopping-site-six.vercel.app/)!

This is my first big complex project I've done as a student of Integrify! It was very challenging to me because I had to deal with a lot of new knowledges.
Online store fetches products from a REST API and displays them in a list of shopping items. Also this app fetches users from a REST API, however only admin of this site can get access to the list of users. The app features theme changing (light/dark), search/cart functionalities, and filtering along with a Product Details page. Also you can log in as a user from the REST API list or even create your own page trhough registration form. As admin you also can edit products, change their categories and delete products. Through this, I learned Redux Toolkit, Typescript, React Context, and Fetch API relatively fast. However, my prior knowledge on similar technologies helped significantly. For example, React Context requires the use of hooks, something I already knew about. The biggest takeaway from this project is combining Fetch API with Redux using Thunk middlewares. It added more layer to Redux capabilities in React. The same applies with React Hook Form which add some security features.

You can log in using users stored in this [link] (https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/users)
